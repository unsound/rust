# 2020-08-31 Triage Log

See the [README](README.md) for details on how this log was gathered.

A quiet week for the most part with the exception of two PRs. The first,
[#76027](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76027), was a rather large
regression that was soon fixed by
[#76030](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76030). The net result seems to
be a small improvement overall on optimized and debug builds.
