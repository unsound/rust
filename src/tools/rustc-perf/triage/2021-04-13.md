#### Regressions

Update stdarch submodule (to before it switched to const generics) [#83776](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83776)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1284da34da56a17ae368e4673920ec4120562cbd&end=d0695c9081b16077d0aed368bccaf437d77ff497&stat=instructions:u) (up to 6.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-closures-debug`)
- Mostly a regression for doc benchmarks, but also a 1.5% regression in memory
  usage on check, debug, and opt builds across all benchmarks.

#### Improvements

- None

#### Mixed

- None

#### Nags requiring follow up

- The [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82964#issuecomment-800663588) from three weeks ago has stalled.
  Likely this needs someone to mentor the author, or to take over the
  investigation.
