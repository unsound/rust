#### Regressions

Rollup of 9 pull requests [#87640](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87640)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ef9549b6c0efb7525c9b012148689c8d070f9bc0&end=1f0a591b3a5963a0ab11a35dc525ad9d46f612e4&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `html5ever-check`)
- Regressions across a few benchmarks, without an obvious cause. May be due to
  [#87385](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87385), but logs don't appear
  to show the warning in those crates at a cursory check. Tagged with
  perf-regression for further investigation.

Implement advance_by, advance_back_by for slice::{Iter, IterMut} [#87387](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87387)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b289bb7fdfcb6f54d825927ab9b5722cabc2a140&end=6b0b07d41f07e1ba5808693d900903499ccf7a32&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.6% on `full` builds of `regex-opt`)
- Unclear cause, likely LLVM-related.
