# 2021-10-19 Triage Log

A week where improvements outweigh regressions. The highlight of the week is the change to split out LLVM profile guided optimization (PGO) and using clang 13 to compile LLVM which led to improvements in many real world crates (e.g., cargo) in the range of 10%. Most regressions were limited and at most in the less than 1% range. We are seeing more performance changes in rollups which are supposed to be performance neutral. We'll have to decide how to best address this.

#### Regressions

Rollup of 6 pull requests [#89858](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89858)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dfc5add915e8bf4accbb7cf4de00351a7c6126a1&end=8c852bc15a058022c9d4175e8ed60da628960800&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `cranelift-codegen`)
- This rollup is the kind that is very hard to diagnose because none of the individual PRs seem to be risky.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89858#issuecomment-947476063) about possible causes and a call out for more investigation.


add `slice::swap_unchecked` [#88540](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88540)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=72d66064e77281536588189a916af28a1819b313&end=1dafe6d1c328d2f0580763e8438a227e490deb10&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.5% on `full` builds of `piston-image`)
- Seems like we're doing more bounds checking than is necessary when using `slice::swap` though this should only happen when debug assertions are on which is not the case in the compiler. 
- It is interesting that this has predominately impacted full build scenarios, but it's not clear why this would be the case.
- It's already been suggested to revert this, and I've left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88540#issuecomment-946736079) as such in the PR.


Associated consts sidebar [#89815](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89815)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8c852bc15a058022c9d4175e8ed60da628960800&end=7807a694c2f079fd3f395821bcc357eee8650071&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.9% on `full` builds of `many-assoc-items`)
- Expected since we're doing more work and the benchmark in question is explicitly meant to test the worst case in this scenario.


#### Improvements

Remove textual span from diagnostic string [#89555](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89555)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=eeb16a2a892c2a29b1da3085e29f39efa3486e1c&end=dfc5add915e8bf4accbb7cf4de00351a7c6126a1&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.9% on `full` builds of `diesel`)


polymorphization: shims and predicates [#89514](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89514)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1d6f24210c4a8f46f9781a56f819a383e590cccf&end=6f53ddfa74ac3c10ceb63ad4a7a9c95e55853c87&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.8% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested`)


Split out LLVM PGO step and use clang 13 to compile LLVM [#89499](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89499)
- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1f12ac87296ac61ec002e0243e7ad5a50364da35&end=5e02151318ddd431aea6d58e23948246c1446044&stat=instructions:u) (up to -13.6% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `cargo`)


Revert "Auto merge of #89709 - clemenswasser:apply_clippy_suggestionsâ€¦ [#89905](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89905)
- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ec724ac0753b7538668308a6aa5b78980b2931bb&end=cd8b56f528631b128f36605b28ae06e36377dc68&stat=instructions:u) (up to -3.3% on `full` builds of `inflate`)
- This directly addresses and improves the performance lost in [#89709](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89709).


#### Mixed

Rollup of 10 pull requests [#89939](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89939)
- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6cc0a764e082d9c0abcf37a768d5889247ba13e2&end=7fbd4ce2768744b3bd2ddf8453b73f4f18dbe5bc&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.7% on `full` builds of `inflate`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6cc0a764e082d9c0abcf37a768d5889247ba13e2&end=7fbd4ce2768744b3bd2ddf8453b73f4f18dbe5bc&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.0% on `full` builds of `diesel`)
- No obvious place where the regressions or improvements are coming from.
- Most likely culprit is [#89915](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89915) as most other PRs in the rollup seem to be pretty low risk.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89939#issuecomment-946747553) saying as much.


Index and hash HIR as part of lowering [#89124](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89124)
- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5dab47dcd8267b8769421b46532414ec36d625e3&end=bd41e09da334697c0f993b36685cb599061d9faa&stat=instructions:u) (up to -5.4% on `full` builds of `cranelift-codegen`)
- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5dab47dcd8267b8769421b46532414ec36d625e3&end=bd41e09da334697c0f993b36685cb599061d9faa&stat=instructions:u) (up to 5.3% on `full` builds of `unused-warnings`)
- Definitely looks related to the change in question (`unused-warnings` shows larges increases in HIR lowering).
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89124#issuecomment-947444364) asking for clarification of next steps.
