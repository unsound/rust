# 2022-02-02 Triage Log

This was a relatively quiet week with regressions and improvements relatively equally each other out. The big exception is with a somewhat large regression in rustdoc which was needed for a large and important architectural change. This could lead to users see somewhat slower doc build times with more memory used especially in projects with large crate dependency graphs.

#### Regressions

rustdoc: Pre-calculate traits that are in scope for doc links [#88679](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88679)
- Average relevant regression: 5.4%
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d502eda250d0090f4990cc6880c88b95a92b4818&end=788b1fe5b79a8b74215022f9df49b0eae68a50b9&stat=instructions:u): 9.1% on `full` builds of `regression-31157 doc`
- All the regressions are localized to rustdoc and are quite substantial but exacerbated by an architectural issue which needs to be solved.
- The regressions are well known and extensively discussed in the PR with the [next steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88679#issuecomment-1021810724) being tracked in an issue.


Store def_id_to_hir_id as variant in hir_owner. [#93373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93373)
- Average relevant regression: 1.2%
- Average relevant improvement: -0.3%
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=86f5e177bca8121e1edc9864023a8ea61acf9034&end=24b8bb13bff98bb747cd403b86596af43aceee78&stat=instructions:u): 5.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `match-stress-enum check`
- This is the first commit (originally bundled with [#93301](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93301)) of a larger PR ([#89278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89278)) which saw larger PR regressions than the two sub PRs combined.
- A more detailed justification for this can be [found here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93373#issuecomment-1027962065), but in general this allows for even more incremental compilation and is thus worth the small immediate compilation performance penalty. 


#### Improvements

- This is the first commit (originally bundled with [#93373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93373)) of a larger PR ([#89278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89278)) which saw larger PR regressions than the two sub PRs combined.


Create `core::fmt::ArgumentV1` with generics instead of fn pointer [#90891](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90891)
- Average relevant regression: 1.2%
- Average relevant improvement: -1.2%
- Largest improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=08df8b81d6e723c66fee579d57d61dc60bc21fc1&end=e58e7b10e13595b4df1b105bfb9ad03c8dee7832&stat=instructions:u): -6.7% on `full` builds of `tokio-webpush-simple opt`
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=08df8b81d6e723c66fee579d57d61dc60bc21fc1&end=e58e7b10e13595b4df1b105bfb9ad03c8dee7832&stat=instructions:u): 2.1% on `full` builds of `keccak check`
- The improvements outweigh the regressions considerably and this was [considered](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90891#issuecomment-970851616) a fine trade off.
