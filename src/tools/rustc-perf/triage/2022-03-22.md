# 2022-03-22 Triage Log

Very quiet week for performance, with just one statistically significant change
landing in the last week. This change was a regression, though primarily in
stress tests, and was a result of a soundness fix.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

#### Regressions

Disable almost certainly unsound early otherwise branch MIR opt [#95161](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95161)
- Arithmetic mean of relevant regressions: 3.1%
- Largest regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3c17c84a386e7badf6b2c6018d172496b3a28a04&end=cf8531064e44a335c7da75c745279457f42660c5&stat=instructions:u): 8.5% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-multi check`
- Minimal impact on primary benchmarks, and as a soundness fix naturally pretty
  justified.

#### Improvements

- No improvements.

#### Mixed

- No mixed results.
