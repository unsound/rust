# 2022-04-19 Triage Log

A rough week, if only in terms of the sheer number of PRs that were flagged as regressions. Going through 31 regressive PR's, 13 of them rollups, is not fun.
There were some nice wins from e.g. [#95968](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95968) and [#95981](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95981).
The main worrisome regression is a 1% compile-time from [#96010](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96010) that seems like it was not expected.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* left comment: An earlier perf run, on I think the same commit series as what was eventually merged, showed no primary regressions at all.
* A number of secondary benchmarks regressed, but they are all stress test microbenchmarks, and should not block landing work of this nature.
* So, I'm chalking the minor amount of regression that was observed up to noise.

* The only PR on the list in this rollup that I could imagine having any effect at all on performance is PR #96156.
* looked at graph, seems like benchmark became more noisy recently, and this is part of the variance injected by that noise.

* the big hit here was to tt-muncher (a secondary benchmark), which regressed on 10 different configurations, by amounts varying from 1.4% up to 3.0%.
* the cachegrind diff for the 3.0% hit is here: https://gist.github.com/7674ad03c8f72705eb5bd2651202f40a
* that cachegrind diff leads pnkfelix to think that PR #95794: "parse_tt: a few more tweaks" is the cause of the regression, specifically commit 4ba609601f1a99ddf3cf0cf70f57c4a045f0f23f
* however, that PR went through multiple rounds of performance evaluation.
* in any case, looking at the graph for tt-muncher indicates that whatever performance hit was suffered, it was subsequently resolved by PR #95928.
