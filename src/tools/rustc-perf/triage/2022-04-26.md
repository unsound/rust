# 2022-04-26 Triage Log

This was, in general, a positive week for compiler performance. There were many concentrated efforts on improving rustdoc performance with a lot of real world crates showing ~4-7% improvements in full build times. Additionally, there was further improvement to `macro_rules!` performance with many real world crates improving performance by as much as 18% in full builds! On the other hand, the regressions were mostly minor and largely relegated to secondary benchmarks.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

#### Regressions

Rollup of 5 pull requests [#96263](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96263) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=09ccb6c59d026b94edae50ba949b22dfc5d65ed1&end=7be1da0319eb5f381bc0aa8559367bb33dfe90a5&stat=instructions:u)

| mean | 2.0% | 6.3% | N/A | N/A | 2.0% |
| max | 3.2% | 6.9% | N/A | N/A | 3.2% |
- The regression in primary benchmarks is dominated by a noisy `syn-1.0.89` (see [rustc-perf#1301](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1301)). However, the regressions in the secondary benchmarks seem real and point towards [#96236](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96236) as the possible cause.
- I ran cachegrind diff on `wg-grammar check full` and got [these results](https://gist.github.com/rylev/8dad0b2dc24733908de28ce34a906692) which shows `<rustc_borrowck::region_infer::Trace as alloc::vec::spec_from_elem::SpecFromElem>::from_elem` being called a lot more often after this change.
- The regressions are not *huge* but they are certainly significant and real. If something obvious stands out to those more familiar with this code, it might be worth poking around.


rustdoc: Unindent doc fragments on `Attributes` construction [#96282](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96282) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0b3404b01b251401e6b45cb1c4df8f883dfab2d7&end=8b2393086f4c41007b5fb02ef0579ffa7046bff2&stat=instructions:u)

- An [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96309) was opened to investigate whether more work is being done that strictly necessary.
- Since the regressions are relatively minor and only constrained to somewhat "artificial" crates (i.e., `hello-world` is the only primary crate impacted), we can [mark this as triaged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96282#issuecomment-1109535756).


Generate synthetic object file to ensure all exported and used symbols participate in the linking [#95604](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95604) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7417110cefda899a685a77557ac2bd7d7ee07e54&end=18b53cefdf7456bf68937b08e377b7e622a115c2&stat=instructions:u)

| max | 0.5% | 0.5% | N/A | N/A | 0.5% |
- This seems to be regressing a bunch of full doc builds. Given this doesn't touch rustdoc, but does touch metadata encoding/decoding, I would assume that's where the perf hit is coming from. 
- I ran cachegrind diff on `helloworld doc full` and [got these results](https://gist.github.com/rylev/772e7dd5e7f133e48bf318a583e44845). It indeed looks like we're calling decoding functions on certain items (attributes and idents) more than previously (albeit with less decoding of spans).
- [Left a comment to the author/reviewer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95604#issuecomment-1109652483) to get more clarification.

- Performance runs [were done](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96294#issuecomment-1106397651) on this change before merging and they did not show perf regressions
- Added a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96294#issuecomment-1109540254) to ensure the issue doesn't get lost. It seems it might be caused by inclusion of `DefId`s when they aren't needed.

- The regression is `syn-1.0.89` which has become noisy (see [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1301) for more details)

#### Mixed

rustdoc: Optimize and refactor doc link resolution [#96135](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96135) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0034bbca260bfa00798d70150970924221688ede&end=d39864d64e6e0762d418f6beeedb4510942fc828&stat=instructions:u)

- The regression in [stm32f4 is expected](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96135#issuecomment-1101397244) and given this is otherwise a big perf win, we'll take the slight perf hit in one benchmark.

- The regression happens in a stress test that is expected to stress the code being changed. 
- After this change visibility is now being correctly hashed which is strictly more work but is the "correct" thing to do. Given this [the regressions are worth it](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93970#issuecomment-1107778525).

- Unfortunate regressions but they are fairly isolated, small, and expected. 
- Majority of the regressions come from the introduction of more local variables which LLVM has to work through. This looks like an area we'll want to work through, but we [shouldn't block this PR on addressing this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96116#issuecomment-1109521059).
