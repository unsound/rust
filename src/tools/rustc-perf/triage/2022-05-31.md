# 2022-05-31 Triage Log

A good week: The regressions were small; some have follow-up PR's in flight to
address them; and we saw a big improvement from PR
[#97345](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97345), which adds more fast
paths for quickly exiting comparisons between two types (such as `BitsImpl<M>`
and `BitsImpl<N>` for const integers `M` and `N`). This improved compile-times
for the `bitmaps` benchmark by 50-65% in some cases (including the trunk
`nalgebra`, according to independent investigation from nnethercote). That same
PR had more modest improvements (1% to 2%) to the compile-times for a number of
other crates. Many thanks to lcnr and nnethercote for some excellent work here!

* aparently making a `Buffer<T>` non-generic (its solely instantiated at `u8`) caused a performance regression.
* there is ongoing follow-up work to address the regression, either by making the buffer generic again, or by adding `#[inline]` annotations.
* see e.g. [PR 97539](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97539)

* This regressed doc-generation for a few primary benchmarks, but I think that might be a inherent cost of a change like this. I marked it as triaged based on that assumption.

Move things to `rustc_type_ir` [#97287](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97287) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=303d916867040e269b54adf3cfc7f5c903dc26ff&end=0f06824013761ed6829887019033f1001e68f623&stat=instructions:u)

* During development, this PR was identified as regressing one primary benchmark, `bitmaps` (in a variety of contexts), and the PR author [said](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97287#issuecomment-1139917174) better to take that perf hit and deal with it later.
* In the PR that landed, the number of regressing variants was smaller, but the affected set of benchmarks slightly larger: [both `bitmaps` and `unicode-normalization`](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=303d916867040e269b54adf3cfc7f5c903dc26ff&end=0f06824013761ed6829887019033f1001e68f623&stat=instructions:u) are affected, regressing by 0.35% to 0.70%.
* My very brief inpsection of the flamegraphs ([old](https://perf.rust-lang.org/perf/processed-self-profile?commit=303d916867040e269b54adf3cfc7f5c903dc26ff&benchmark=bitmaps-3.1.0-check&scenario=full&type=flamegraph), [new](https://perf.rust-lang.org/perf/processed-self-profile?commit=0f06824013761ed6829887019033f1001e68f623&benchmark=bitmaps-3.1.0-check&scenario=full&type=flamegraph)) didn't show any smoking guns.
* At this point I think we can just live with this performance hit.

#### Improvements

Add suggestion for relaxing static lifetime bounds on dyn trait impls in NLL [#97284](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97284) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=764b8615e9149431d8790e3c07cb663642fe393d&end=ed76b773b57cf0aa48ec4e2fc6d6a3f7a9079491&stat=instructions:u)

* This managed to improve performance (slightly), probably because it [restructured](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97284/commits/3c6c8d5a8dbf4db20450ed5793ef35f29c13466c#r882897413) the `CallArgument` and that had fallout that ended up being positive overall (despite our intuition being that it would hurt performance due to the increase in size).
* It might be nice to confirm that hypothesis independently (by isolating just that structural change and confirming that it has a similar effect on performance here) ...
* ... but, the improvements are essentially isolated to just the secondary wg-grammar benchmark, so its not really worth too much digging, except if we think it might reveal other structural changes we should make elsewhere.

#### Mixed

add a deep fast_reject routine [#97345](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97345) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=cbdce423201f1b155c46f3ec690a644cf3b4ba53&end=4a99c5f504ab65a0fd9d60f515811e1d9cff8c0a&stat=instructions:u)

* this was great, as noted in summary.

* This had some small improvements to primary benchmarks.
* The CTFE stress test regressed, but I assume that was expected since this was a change to the CTFE engine (to address some ICE's).

* This had various improvements to our primary benchmarks' instruction counts.
* The other big thing to observe: the max-rss was improved in several primary
  benchmarks (by 1% to 6%), and some secondary benchmarks saw even more
  significant improvements to their max-rss.

* This was a targeted PR to address the regressions introduced by PR [#95563](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95563) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=acfd327fd4e3a302ebb0a077f422a527a7935333&end=653463731a7f01f519cf85f444869def27f00395&stat=instructions:u).
* It seems to succeed at recovering the instruction-count performance lost in that PR.
* It doesn't *quite* recover all of the max-rss lost
  (PR [#97383 improves max-rss by about 3.75%](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6ac8adad1f7d733b5b97d1df4e7f96e73a46db42&end=209f91e1787d0d29a0e566fa93f35d52e60ea84a&stat=max-rss)
  while PR [#95563 degraded max-rss by about 4%](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=acfd327fd4e3a302ebb0a077f422a527a7935333&end=653463731a7f01f519cf85f444869def27f00395&stat=max-rss)),

* On the primary benchmarks, this mostly yielded small improvements; the one exception was `serde_derive` (debug), which regressed by ~0.5% for the full and incr-full variants.
* Looking at the flamegraphs for the before and after commits, and at the [table at bottom of details page](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=116201eefebcf45074ae232377e7145f5fbb704b&base_commit=4f39fb1f34d4bd25d9ce96afe7b2d109f073e286&benchmark=serde_derive-1.0.136-debug&scenario=full), it seems like the instruction-count regression is in `codegen_module`
* Looking at the history of serde_derive-debug (massively zoomed in on the "Percent Delta from First" Graph kind), it seems reasonable to think that something *did* happen on this PR.
* .... but I also don't really think its a big enough regression to be worth tearing our hair out over. This is a (smallish) win overall, and even for serde_derive-debug, it is a small regression in the context of much larger wins, so overall the trajectory is good.
* Marked as triaged.

* The primary regressions are mostly in variants of stm32f4, with a two serde and one syn thrown in for good measure.
* The improvements are solely to ctfe stress test, which I guess makes sense given the PR?
* Anyway, the regressions seem minor, and they are contained to an unstable feature that the stdlib is using.
* Marking as triaged.

* This is adding a fast-path so that `format!("literal")` will compile into the same code as `"literal".to_owned()`.
* The primary regression is solely contained to `bitmaps`.
* Its possible that the regression to `bitmaps` is due to `format!("literal")` being totally unused in that code; all instances of `format!` there take an additional argument.
  So its *possible* that the extra code to check about whether to use the fast-path is slowing things down there.
* But I personally don't believe that explanation here: Unless I'm misunderstanding the code, there is some amount of macro-expansion into multiple instances of `format!`, but
  most of the expanded code is going to be dominated by all the `impl` blocks, not the relatively few `format!` instances. (Unless I massively misunderstand how the macros and/or codegen and/or inlining end up linking up here.)
* So: I don't believe the best hypothesis I have for what is happening here.
* But I also do not think the regression here is large enough to warrant further investigation.
* Marking as triaged.
