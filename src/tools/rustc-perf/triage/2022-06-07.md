# 2022-06-07 Triage Log

A busy week in compiler performance, but fortunately improvements outweighed regressions. The biggest improvements came from @nnethercote's work on making the decoding of `SourceFile::lines` lazy which significantly cuts the costs of decoding crate metadata. The biggest regressions came from the removal of json handling in `rustc_serialize` which has been a multi-month effort to improve the maintainability of json (de-)serialization in the compiler.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

- Ran cache grind diff and saw that `ObligationForest::process_obligations` is getting called a lot more. 
- I'm very unfamiliar with trait resolution, so I'm unsure if this is a red herring or not. 
- In any case, [here](https://gist.github.com/rylev/8e5fd44e2ee0db7f3dd449eb0e88ccbd) is the full diff. 
- Left a comment as such [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89862#issuecomment-1148733903)

- @nnethercote was not able to reproduce the regressions in a local build, and it seems the consensus is that the regressions are worth the hit.

#### Mixed

Add `#[inline]` to `Vec`'s `Deref/DerefMut` [#97553](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97553) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=02916c4c75912f70b651c0b20b501444ce2ca231&end=395a09c3dafe0c7838c9ca41d2b47bb5e79a5b6d&stat=instructions:u)

- As with any chance to inlining, performance is expected to change and to not always have a positive impact. 
- The improvements outweigh the regressions (especially in primary benchmarks), and so it doesn't seem worth it to dig too much more into this.

- I'm a bit confused as this PR was opened to address a performance regression, but it seems to be itself a partial perf regression (at least in instruction counts). 
- This causes a near 4% perf regression in [serde_derive-1.0.136](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/benchmarks/serde_derive-1.0.136). Granted that particular benchmark has been somewhat noisy but not nearly to the level seen here.
