# 2022-06-14 Triage Log

A mixed week. I suppose it is best to focus on the fact we made some big
improvements to a large number of primary benchmarks, at the cost of some
smaller regressions to a smaller number of primary benchmarks.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

* stm32f4-0.14.0 regressed for check+debug+opt on incr-patched: negate. diesel-1.4.8 regressed for check on incr-patched: println
* Given that all the regressions are to incremental, I'm assuming this is because of #97058
* skimming over the [perf details for stm32f4 check](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=7fe2c4b00dfbc33643e1af4b293eb057306a8339&base_commit=91cacb3faf987805675e39aca41859ec1fcabef3&benchmark=stm32f4-0.14.0-check&scenario=incr-patched:%20negate), it *seems* like the bulk of the time delta is coming from `expand_crate`. A total time delta of 0.66, and the biggest contributors to that delta are `expand_crate` (0.033), `incr_comp_load_dep_graph` (0.015), `misc_checking_1` (0.007), `hir_owner_nodes` (0.005), `generate_crate_metadata` (0.005), `incr_comp_encode_dep_graph` (0.004), and `wf_checking` (0.004). The remainder are <= 0.003, most of them <= 0.000.
* given the relatively small size and scope of the regression, and the fact that it was in a rollup, I do not think this is worth investigating further. marked as triaged.

* diesel-1.4.8 regressed on check full, opt full, and check incr-full, by about 0.3% each time.
* rylev says that diesel has started to become more noisy in its behavior, perhaps since we turned on PGO.
* I do not think this is worth investigating further. marked as triaged.

* All six regressions are variations of issue-88862: {opt,debug} x { incr-full, full, incr-unchanged }. The two incr-unchanged cases regressed by 0.94% and 1.72% . The full cases regressed by 7.13% and 7.57% . The incr-full cases regressed by 7.86% and 7.80%.
* None of these PRs strike me as something that would cause a problem for the code exercised by #88862. (I briefly thought it might be #98012, but issue-88862 doesn't exercise HKT's...)
* but also, given that issue-88862 is a canary that is trying to catch a catastrophic regression, I think we can accept a 7-8% regression here.

* diesel-1.4.8 regressed by 0.5% for variations on check/debug/opt and incr-full/full. That's the only primary regression, and its within the noise level that we're currently associating with diesel, I think.
* The other regressions are wf-projection-stress-65510, projection-caching, regression-31157, and wg-grammar.
* wf-projection-stress-65510 and regression-31157 are canaries where we are trying to catch a *massive* regression, not a minor one like the ones presented here.
* given that this is a rollup and the remaining regressions are well under 0.5%, I think that's the limit to the amount of investigation I want to do here.
