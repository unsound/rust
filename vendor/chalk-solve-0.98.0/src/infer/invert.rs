    /// goals that do not contain any free variables, then this is a
    /// no-op operation.
    ///
    /// If `value` contains any existential variables that have not
    /// yet been assigned a value, then this function will return
    /// `None`, indicating that we cannot prove negation for this goal
    /// yet.  This follows the approach in Clark's original
    /// [negation-as-failure paper][1], where negative goals are only
    /// permitted if they contain no free (existential) variables.
    ///
    /// [1]: https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/NegAsFailure.pdf
    ///
    /// Restricting free existential variables is done because the
    /// semantics of such queries is not what you expect: it basically
    /// treats the existential as a universal. For example, consider:
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// struct Vec<T> {}
    /// struct i32 {}
    /// struct u32 {}
    /// trait Foo {}
    /// impl Foo for Vec<u32> {}
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If we ask `exists<T> { not { Vec<T>: Foo } }`, what should happen?
    /// If we allow negative queries to be definitively answered even when
    /// they contain free variables, we will get a definitive *no* to the
    /// entire goal! From a logical perspective, that's just wrong: there
    /// does exists a `T` such that `not { Vec<T>: Foo }`, namely `i32`. The
    /// problem is that the proof search procedure is actually trying to
    /// prove something stronger, that there is *no* such `T`.
    ///
    /// An additional complication arises around free universal
    /// variables.  Consider a query like `not { !0 = !1 }`, where
    /// `!0` and `!1` are placeholders for universally quantified
    /// types (i.e., `TyKind::Placeholder`). If we just tried to
    /// prove `!0 = !1`, we would get false, because those types
    /// cannot be unified -- this would then allow us to conclude that
    /// `not { !0 = !1 }`, i.e., `forall<X, Y> { not { X = Y } }`, but
    /// this is clearly not true -- what if X were to be equal to Y?
    ///
    /// Interestingly, the semantics of existential variables turns
    /// out to be exactly what we want here. So, in addition to
    /// forbidding existential variables in the original query, the
    /// `negated` query also converts all universals *into*
    /// existentials. Hence `negated` applies to `!0 = !1` would yield
    /// `exists<X,Y> { X = Y }` (note that a canonical, i.e. closed,
    /// result is returned). Naturally this has a solution, and hence
    /// `not { !0 = !1 }` fails, as we expect.
    ///
    /// (One could imagine converting free existentials into
    /// universals, rather than forbidding them altogether. This would
    /// be conceivable, but overly strict. For example, the goal
    /// `exists<T> { not { ?T: Clone }, ?T = Vec<i32> }` would come
    /// back as false, when clearly this is true. This is because we
    /// would wind up proving that `?T: Clone` can *never* be
    /// satisfied (which is false), when we only really care about
    /// `?T: Clone` in the case where `?T = Vec<i32>`. The current
    /// version would delay processing the negative goal (i.e., return
    /// `None`) until the second unification has occurred.)
