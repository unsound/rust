/// A union-find data structure. The data structure can allocate
/// `Idx`s, indicating eclasses, and can merge eclasses together.
///
/// Running `union(a, b)` will change the canonical `Idx` of `a` or `b`.
/// Usually, this is chosen based on what will minimize path lengths,
/// but it is also possible to _pin_ an eclass, such that its canonical `Idx`
/// won't change unless it gets unioned with another pinned eclass.
///
/// In the context of the egraph pass, merging two pinned eclasses
/// is very unlikely to happen â€“ we do not know a single concrete test case
/// where it does. The only situation where it might happen looks as follows:
///
/// 1. We encounter terms `A` and `B`, and the optimizer does not find any
///    reason to union them together.
/// 2. We encounter a term `C`, and we rewrite `C -> A`, and separately, `C -> B`.
///
/// Unless `C` somehow includes some crucial hint without which it is hard to
/// notice that `A = B`, there's probably a rewrite rule that we should add.
///
/// Worst case, if we do merge two pinned eclasses, some nodes will essentially
/// disappear from the GVN map, which only affects the quality of the generated
/// code.
