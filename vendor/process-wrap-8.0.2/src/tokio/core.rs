/// Wrapper for `tokio::process::Child`.
///
/// This trait exposes most of the functionality of the underlying [`Child`]. It is implemented for
/// [`Child`] and by wrappers.
///
/// The required methods are `inner`, `inner_mut`, and `into_inner`. That provides access to the
/// underlying `Child` and allows the wrapper to be dropped and the `Child` to be used directly if
/// necessary.
///
/// It also makes it possible for all the other methods to have default implementations. Some are
/// direct passthroughs to the underlying `Child`, while others are more complex.
///
/// Here's a simple example of a wrapper:
///
/// ```rust
/// use process_wrap::tokio::*;
/// use tokio::process::Child;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct YourChildWrapper(Child);
///
/// impl TokioChildWrapper for YourChildWrapper {
///     fn inner(&self) -> &Child {
///         &self.0
///     }
///
///     fn inner_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Child {
///         &mut self.0
///     }
///
///     fn into_inner(self: Box<Self>) -> Child {
///         (*self).0
///     }
/// }
